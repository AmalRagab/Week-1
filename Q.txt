1- What is the difference between a class and an object?

➜A class serves as a framework or template that specifies attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).

➜An object is a specific instance of a class, containing actual data and capable of executing the methods defined in the class.

2- What is the purpose of using getters and setters in a class?

➜Getters provide a way to access private fields in a controlled manner.

➜Setters control how values are assigned to fields, often allowing for validation or additional logic before modifying the field.

3- What is the difference between a Public and Private access modifier?

➜Public: The member can be accessed from any part of the program.

➜Private: The member is restricted to access only within the class itself, ensuring the principles of encapsulation and hiding the internal state.
